This repository includes the source programs, data, and figures used in a paper entitled, "Stabilization mechanism of the feedback instability with height-resolved ionosphere and Alfven resonator models" by T.-H. Watanabe, J. Hiwatari, and S. Maeyama, submitted to Physics of Plasmas.

Note: Figure numbers are changed because Fig.1 is newly added during the review process. (Fig.1 -> Fig.2, Fig.2->Fig3, Fig.3->Fig.4, Fig.4->Fig.5, and Fig.5->Fig.6 in the revised manuscript)
